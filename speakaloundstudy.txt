trying to figure out what everything does (mashing buttons)
clearly can go through ...abcd
so left thumbsticks lets me select

oh I see! so these are input commands

how do I select? (with letters organge)

why is one of them gold?

okay so these two ontrol nums or capitols
this controls pointer

i don't think these do anything

--after explanation--

so lets see if I can do this
this is cool
awshit (mistake)
umm
damnit

why is it doing that (bounced)

okay still trying  so i need to select it
perfect
it seems like if I'm really deliberate, it seems like it won't bounce.

this is cool though
augh
it's a nice system

are you guys thinking about doing anything with these (buttons)


hmm

augh


oh so you do have..it's all in here though...for punctuation

--another round--
i'll just type in thursday
that made the select much easier. 

It was fun helping, it was pretty cool.
